# 03-Text-adventure

I tried my best to make an interesting little test adventure using Python as an interactive iction game engine.
While I used Json files to store dictionaries which made up the majority of the game.

It ended up being more of an interactive story rather than a game since the player doesn't have any actual impact.
There are different patcchs to the end and extra information to be found but in the end the ending is never changed and there is no way to lose.

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

I didn't really know how to implement more than 1 json file into the game engine so that's good to know.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

I honestly didn't think of the option of choosing different adventures I think that was a good touch

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

There were some typos here and changing the win conditions to happen at the end room would be good. That way you can have a message like "Hey Bill's not dead so thats a court case avoided. Congrats!" or ya know...something like that lol

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 again there were just some typos but it's not like I couldn't understand what was going on.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Again, just some typos

 Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 It sure does

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

You conveyed what you tried to do perfectly fine. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I like the short little stories and I really felt like Bill was just the worst ever so good immersion haha. You did a good job and went the extra mile to add some extra spice to your text adventure with the multiple games. Good work!
